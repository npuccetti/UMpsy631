Fall 2017: first-year stats course

Hello and Welcome! 

In order to get the most out of our stats course this semester, I am practicing with R data sharing skills. This repository will be a collection of scripts used to accomplish the book exercises. Additionally, it can house code used for in-class demo's or other 'related' functions! Github is not 100% intuitive, so if you would like to access or constribute to the repository and need some assitance, just let me know.
