Fall 2017 first year statistics course

Hello and Welcome! 
In order to get the most out of the stats course this semester I am hoping to hone my R and data sharing skills. This repository will be a collection of scripts to accomplish some of the tasks in the stats course that were either demo'ed in SPSS or required for the book exercises.
